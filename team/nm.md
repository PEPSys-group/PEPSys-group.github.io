I am an EXDIGIT Research Associate (PostDoc) at Salzburg Research and associated member of the Privacy Engineering and Policy-Aligned Systems (PEPSys) group at the Paris Lodron University of Salzburg’s faculty for Digital and Analytical Sciences, Austria. My research focuses on real-world distributed technologies, energy efficiency, grid greening, and electrifying everything. This particularly includes:

* Anomaly detection in distributed computing by applying the ML models,
* Novel technical concepts, mechanisms, and components fostering electricity consumption enhancement and beyond

Besides other activities, I contribute to Salzburg's [EXDIGIT initiative](https://www.plus.ac.at/digital-and-analytical-sciences/fachbereiche-einrichtungen/einrichtungen/exdigit/?lang=en) led by [Faculty of Digital and Analytical Sciences (DAS) at Universität Salzburg](https://www.plus.ac.at/aihi/der-fachbereich/team/?lang=en) in cooperation with [Innovation Salzburg GmbH](https://www.innovation-salzburg.at/en/projekt/exdigit/) and [Salzburg Research](https://www.salzburgresearch.at/2024/kooperation-fuer-interdisziplinaere-forschung-in-salzburg/).

# Micro-CV

I received my Bachelor's and Master's in computer science from University of Isfahan, Iran, followed by teaching and research position at the [Institute of Information Technology at AAU Klagenfurt](https://itec.aau.at/new-team-member-joined-itec/). From November 2022 until December 2023, I was a doctoral researcher and developer in [DataCloud EU project](https://www.datacloud.eu/), contributed from the AAU side. Aside from the DataCloud project, I also collaborated in [CarinthianFog](https://c3.itec.aau.at/) and [GAIA](https://athena.itec.aau.at/gaia/). In July 2024, I was appointed as PostDococtoral researcher for EXDIGIT project hired by Salzburg Research in collaboration with the Paris Lodron University of Salzburg.
