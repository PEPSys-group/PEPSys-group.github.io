I am an EXDIGIT Research Associate (PostDoc) in the Privacy Engineering and Policy-Aligned Systems (PEPSys) group at the Paris Lodron University of Salzburg, Austria. My research focuses on privacy-preserving authentication in vehicular ad-hoc networks and appying technologies such as zero-knowledge proofs and attribtue based credentials. This particularly includes:

* designing short-lived credential systems that enable immediate accountability while preserving user privacy in vehicular and IoT networks.
* developing adaptive security policies that adjust trust boundaries based on changing contexts, reducing reliance on any single component in distributed infrastructures.
* creating flexible cryptographic protocols tailored to the diverse resource constraints and threat levels found across modern edge and IoT ecosystems.

Under the umbrella of the interdisciplinary EXDIGIT initiative, I aim to bridge my research in the context of applied cryptography, zero-trust models, and distributed system performance into the wider area of privacy engineering and policy-aligned systems.

# Micro-CV

I received my Master’s degree in Networks and Security from Sapienza Università di Roma in 2018, developing novel techniques for data exfiltration and biometrics-based applications. I then got my doctoral degree in 2024 at Karlstad University, Sweden. During my PhD, I mostly focused on privacy-preserving cryptographic techniques for vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs). In March 2025, I was appointed as a post-doctoral researcher for EXDIGIT project by the University of Salzburg, Austria.
