# Jens Leicht

I am a Research Associate (PostDoc) in the Privacy Engineering and Policy-Aligned Systems (PEPSys) group at the Paris Lodron University of Salzburg, Austria. My current research focuses on privacy-preserving processing of electricity data from smart meters. This particularly includes:

* investigating the relation between anonymization and data utility in the context of electricity data
* metrics-based privacy-utility trade-offs for general anonymization schemes
* domain-specific approaches for anonymization and privacy-preserving analytics of electricity data


As part of the [DAWN](../projects#dawn) (**D**ata-driven **A**nalysis and Optimization of Lo**w** Voltage **N**etworks) project I investigate the impact of privacy-enhancing technologies (esp. anonymization) on the utility of power data.

## Micro-CV

I received my Master’s degree in *Applied Computer Science* (specialization in distributed, dependable systems) from the University of Duisburg-Essen in 2018.
My Master's thesis, titled *Privacy Policy Specification Framework for Addressing End-Users' Privacy Requirements*, sparked my interest in the privacy and data protection field.
In 2025 I successfully defended by PhD (Dr.-Ing.) with the title *PriPoCoG: A Prolog-Based Framework for Handling GDPR-Compliant Privacy Policies* at the [distributed systems research group](https://vs.uni-due.de/en/person/leicht/) at the University of Duisburg-Essen.
In January 2026, I joined the [DAWN](../projects#dawn) (**D**ata-driven **A**nalysis and Optimization of Lo**w** Voltage **N**etworks) project as a research associate (PostDoc) at the Paris Lodron University of Salzburg, Austria.
