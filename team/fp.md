# Univ.-Prof. Dr.-Ing. Frank Pallas

I am professor for Privacy Engineering and Policy-Aligned Systems (PEPSys) at the Paris Lodron University of Salzburg’s faculty for Digital and Analytical Sciences, Austria. My research combines and bridges technical and non-technical (especially legal) aspects of cutting-edge, real-world, and enterprise- or society-grade technologies and systems. This particularly includes:

* Techno-legal privacy engineering, especially also including aspects beyond anonymity and security
* Novel technical concepts, mechanisms, and components fostering policy-alignment beyond privacy / data protection law
* Metrics- and experiment-driven assessment and operation of privacy- and policy-alignment-techniques (e.g., anonymity guarantees, utility-metrics, performance-overheads, etc.)
* Societal impacts of emerging technologies and techno-legal implications (“technology-policy co-design”)

# Projects and other Inquiries

Being dedicated to real-world systems and the respectively arising intricacies in bringing privacy and policy-aligned technologies into practice, I particularly enjoy spotting new challenges from and validating my reseearch results in real-world usecases. National and international projects as well as a broad variety of other collaborations with partners from research and industry are thus integral to my work. For respective inquiries, just get in touch and drop me a line.

# Micro-CV

I received my Ph.D. in computer science from TU Berlin, Germany, followed by senior research positions at the KIT’s Center for Applied Legal Studies and the FZI Forschungszentrum Informatik – both in Karlsruhe, Germany. Before joining PLUS, I held an intermediate professorship for Computers & Society / Computers & Law at TU Berlin and was was senior researcher at TU Berlin’s department for [Information Systems Engineering](https://www.tu.berlin/ise).
