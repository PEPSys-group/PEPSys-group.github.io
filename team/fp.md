# Univ.-Prof. Dr.-Ing. Frank Pallas

Frank Pallas is professor for Privacy Engineering and Policy-Aligned Systems (PEPSys) at the Paris Lodron University of Salzburg’s faculty for Digital and Analytical Sciences, Austria.

This particularly includes:

* Techno-legal privacy engineering, especially also including aspects beyond anonymity and security
* Novel technical concepts, mechanisms, and components fostering policy-alignment beyond privacy / data protection law
* Societal impacts of emerging technologies and techno-legal implications (“technology-policy co-design”)
