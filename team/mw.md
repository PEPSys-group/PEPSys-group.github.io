I am a computer science bachelor's studendt and a student assistant in the PEPSys group at Paris Lodron University of Salzburg. I am currently working on my bachelor's thesis,which focuses on discriminating bias in large language models (LLMs), especially with regard to gender and race.
Therefore I evaluate multiple common LLMs through different prompts related to recruiting to demonstrate their usefulness and bias.
In that line, I contribute research on bias and fairness evaluation of LLMs to the RAPID [project](/projects).
