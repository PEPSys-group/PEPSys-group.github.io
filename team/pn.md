I am a master’s student in Data Science and a student assistant in the PEPSys group at Paris Lodron University of Salzburg. I am currently working on my master’s thesis within the team in which I explore alignment methods for large language models, focusing particularly on their evaluation. This includes:
* Design of an experimentation framework that enables reproducible and transparent evaluation of LLM alignment methods,
* Development of an LLM-based application as a practical test use case.

These activities are part of the RAPID [project](../projects).

## Micro-CV
In 2023, I received my bachelor’s degree in Business Information Technology from the Duale Hochschule Baden-Württemberg in Karlsruhe, Germany. As part of this corporate study program, I was taking on projects as a software and requirements engineer at my partner company Siemens AG. Since September 2023, I am enrolled in the Data Science master’s program at the Paris Lodron University Salzburg. During the course of my master’s, I spent a semester abroad at The University of Hong Kong and 14 months as a student worker at Red Bull, where I got enthusiastic about testing, evaluating, and understanding Generative AI models.
