I am a research associate and PhD candidate at the Privacy Engineering and Policy-Aligned Systems (PEPSys) group of Paris Lodron University of Salzburg. 
My research expertise is in the field of privacy engineering, with a focus on personal data access and data portability. 
To turn the unused concept of data access into a valuable source of information, I explore different steps of the user journey and build technical systems that remove barriers hindering users from exercising their access rights. 
In particular, this includes the following challenges and approaches:

* Obstructive request processes, tackled by employing means of web automation.
* Heterogeneous data representation, unified through graph inference methods.
* Missing interoperability, addressed by techniques of data integration, specifically schema matching.

In 2024, I joined the PEPSys group at the Paris Lodron University of Salzburg’s faculty for Digital and Analytical Sciences. Previously, I worked as a research associate at the [Information Systems Engineering](https://www.tu.berlin/ise) department of TU Berlin. Within my work at TU Berlin, I discovered my passion for privacy engineering in the context of the [DaSKITA project](https://www.tu.berlin/ise/projekte/daskita), which was focused on legally compliant and user-friendly design of transparency and data access rights. Moreover, I was involved in teaching at bachelor and master level (esp. "Information Governance" and "Cloud Native Architecture and Engineering").
In 2022 I completed my studies of Information Systems Management at TU Berlin with a master thesis on "Privacy Preserving Automated Schema Matching in a Distributed Setting".
