Huh...? 

Yes, indeed, this could be you! We're continuously searching for new colleagues eager to embark on our journey towards truly interdisciplinary technologies. 

Sharing our excitement for techno-legal interdependencies of cutting-edge, enterprise-grade technologies? Experience in interdisciplinary research at the intersection of IT and  the law, preferably relating to recent and upcoming regulations? Looking for a place to grow and to establish something new from ground up with a can-do-attitude? Hungry for mountains, rivers, and a really awesome place to live?
