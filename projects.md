Recently established in our new environment in Salzburg, we are currently looking for new national and international project opportunities as well as other collaborations with partners from research and industry. Interested in joint activities along our [lines of research](/research)? [Get in touch](mailto:frank.pallas@plus.ac.at)!

## Current projects

### EXDIGIT 

[**Excellence in Digital Sciences and Interdisciplinary Technologies**](https://www.plus.ac.at/digital-and-analytical-sciences/fachbereiche-einrichtungen/einrichtungen/exdigit/?lang=en)

In 2022, the Paris Lodron University of Salzburg (PLUS) established the new Faculty of Digital and Analytical Sciences (DAS). The EXDIGIT project aims to establish this newly founded faculty as an interdisciplinary research platform with critical mass and international visibility in the aforementioned digital topics. The PEPSys @ PLUS group is one piece within this initiative, along the "sibling" groups for [Interactive Intelligent Systems](https://christinebauer.eu/) and [Space and Place in the Information Sciences](https://www.space-and-place.net/) as well as many further activities.

## Past Projects

Before joining PEPSys @ PLUS, our [team members](/team) were involved in the following projects at TU Berlin's [Information Systems Engineering group](https://www.tu.berlin/ise) (in chronological order, covering projects since 2017):

### GANGES

[**Assurance of Anonymity Guarantees in Enterprise Streaming-Applications (Gewährleistung von Anonymitäts-Garantien in Enterprise-Streaminganwendungen)**](https://www.tu.berlin/en/ise/research-projects/ganges)

Assuring anonymity guarantees is crucial for the implementation of novel, data-driven applications, and business models. Basic models and techniques such as k-anonymity or differential privacy already exist but are barely used in practice. This can be attributed to a lack of support for complex data types as particularly relevant in real-world applications as well as to insufficient addressing of communication and architectural models as broadly used in enterprise environments and usecases – especially regarding the paradigm of stream processing. Through consequent integration of the three aspects “anonymity”, “data utility” and “integrability / overheads”, the project provides important contributions to the concrete applicability of modern anonymization techniques and, thus, to the actual practicability of novel, data-driven applications and business models.

* Partners: [TU Dresden, Privacy & Security group (Germany)](https://tu-dresden.de/ing/informatik/sya/ps), [Ampeers Energy (Germany)](https://www.ampeersenergy.de/)
* Overall Funding: 2.0 mio €
* Funded by: Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF, DE)
* Project duration: 12/2022 - 12/2025
* Involved PEPSys members and role: [Frank Pallas](/team/fp) (PI and overall project lead, until leaving TU Berlin)

### TEADAL

[**Trustworthy, Energy-Aware Federated Data Lakes Along the Computing Continuum**](https://www.teadal.eu/)

The so-called Cloud-Edge Continuum, which enables the operation and management of data both close to in-field sensors as the data sources (the edge) and in remote cloud data lakes in the backend, provides initial answers to address availability and performance issues in modern, data-driven and data-heavy applications. TEADAL addresses issues such as confidentiality and trustworthiness of data within respective settings and, in particular, beyond the organizational context while also taking questions of energy-efficiency into account.
