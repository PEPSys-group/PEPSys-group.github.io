Recently established in our new environment in Salzburg, we are currently looking for new national and international project opportunities as well as other collaborations with partners from research and industry. Interested in joint activities along our [lines of research](/research)? [Get in touch](mailto:frank.pallas@plus.ac.at)!

## Current projects (most recently started first)

### FTZ Cybersecurity

**Research and Transfer Center for Data-Driven Evaluation of Security- and Privacy-Technologies**

The overall goal of the research and transfer center is to establish and implement broad, non-discriminatory, and openly accessible knowledge on cybersecurity and privacy, particularly including technology transfer for the public, policymakers, regional companies, and students of partner organizations across the Salzburg region. The independent, cooperative research and transfer center for will synergistically integrate existing research groups and activities in the involved institutions, following the idea of smart specialization. Last but not least, the center will contribute to profile development, specialization, and visibility of the research institutions in this domain and promote long-term and sustainable personnel development in the R&D sector.

The PEPSys @ PLUS group will particularly engage in the transfer of privacy approaches and technologies towards practical application in real-world enterprise-grade systems and in establishing solid techno-legal assessment models.

### RAPID

**Reliable AI for Public Law and Intelligent Decision-making**

Public administration is under pressure to fulfill an increasing number of tasks with shrinking budgets while maintaining reasonable processing times and high decision quality. Modern off-the-shelf Large Language Models (LLMs; e.g., Llama, Mistral) offer significant potential to enhance efficiency in administrative procedures.

By combining expertise from diverse legal domains (e.g., fundamental rights, data protection law, AI law) and computer science (e.g., applied AI research, privacy engineering), RAPID lays the legal and technical foundations for the responsible and robust use of AI, particularly LLMs, in administrative procedures.

Specifically, RAPID aims to identify, train, adapt, and test suitable LLMs for specific use cases in public administration. Each of these steps requires extensive legal analysis, encompassing, inter alia, fundamental rights, data protection law, and AI law. RAPID selects two areas of private sector administration ("Privatwirtschaftsverwaltung") and two areas of sovereign administration ("Hoheitsverwaltung") to account for different legal and technical frameworks. Together with our associated partner, Land Salzburg, heating cost allowance, housing subsidies, pest control orders under the Austrian Forest Act, and the new Austrian Freedom of Information Act have been identified as promising and consciously diverse (in terms of subjects, legal givens, and complexity) fields of application. This selection and the project’s interdisciplinary approach ensure that its findings are not only robust but also broadly transferable to other areas of public administration.

The PEPSys @ PLUS group focuses on the technical aspects, particularly the selection, adaptation, and assessment of LLMs, respective experimentation, and prototyping. Soundly integrating these with perspectives from the second scientific partner will lead to novel techno-legal insights for the responsible use of AI in the public sector.

### DAWN

**Data-driven Analysis and Optimization of Low Voltage Networks**

DAWN's goal is to optimize resource utilization in the energy system through digitalization and the effective use of data. The project aims to create a high-quality data foundation that can be used for more accurate forecasts and targeted resource allocation. To this end, a reliable database will be created through the collection and analysis of measured values, such as smart meter data or additional measurements in the low-voltage grid. This data will contribute to improving grid calculations and forecasts. Furthermore, initial data-driven analysis and forecasting models are being developed, and optimization potential is being identified. The research questions are aimed at both grid operators and energy suppliers, thus creating the basis for an innovation ecosystem in the smart grid. 

For grid operators, the research investigates how smart meter data can be used to gain a better understanding of the impact of customer installations on the grid. Key questions include the identification of installation characteristics (e.g., photovoltaic systems, electric vehicle charging points) and their influence on grid behavior. The goal is to improve synthetic load and generation profiles and to analyze customer elasticity. For energy suppliers, the research investigates how representative real-time data can be used to better forecast residual load (as part of the total load of the balancing group) in energy trading. Key questions concern the selection and number of customer installations whose live data should be collected, as well as the seasonal and situational fluctuations in the required data sources.

The PEPSys @ PLUS group researches the application of privacy techniques – esp. anonymization schemes – to the employed data and conducts experiments illuminating the interdependencies between anonymization and data utility, particularly supporting empirically grounded trade-offs.

## Past Projects

Before joining PEPSys @ PLUS, our [team members](/team) were involved in the following projects at TU Berlin's [Information Systems Engineering group](https://www.tu.berlin/ise) (in chronological order, covering projects since 2017):

### GANGES

[**Assurance of Anonymity Guarantees in Enterprise Streaming-Applications (Gewährleistung von Anonymitäts-Garantien in Enterprise-Streaminganwendungen)**](https://www.tu.berlin/en/ise/research-projects/ganges)

Assuring anonymity guarantees is crucial for the implementation of novel, data-driven applications, and business models. Basic models and techniques such as k-anonymity or differential privacy already exist but are barely used in practice. This can be attributed to a lack of support for complex data types as particularly relevant in real-world applications as well as to insufficient addressing of communication and architectural models as broadly used in enterprise environments and usecases – especially regarding the paradigm of stream processing. Through consequent integration of the three aspects “anonymity”, “data utility” and “integrability / overheads”, the project provides important contributions to the concrete applicability of modern anonymization techniques and, thus, to the actual practicability of novel, data-driven applications and business models.

### TEADAL

[**Trustworthy, Energy-Aware Federated Data Lakes Along the Computing Continuum**](https://www.teadal.eu/)

The so-called Cloud-Edge Continuum, which enables the operation and management of data both close to in-field sensors as the data sources (the edge) and in remote cloud data lakes in the backend, provides initial answers to address availability and performance issues in modern, data-driven and data-heavy applications. TEADAL addresses issues such as confidentiality and trustworthiness of data within respective settings and, in particular, beyond the organizational context while also taking questions of energy-efficiency into account.

### Gaia-X 4 PLC-AAD

[**Gaia-X for Product Lifecycle Across Automated Driving**](https://www.gaia-x4plcaad.info/)

The development of automated driving functions is becoming increasingly complex and costly due to the required combination of software and hardware and their safeguarding. At the same time, OEMs and suppliers are facing ever new challenges in the design of their supply chains. In both cases, improvements require bringing together large amounts of data from different sources. Gaia-X 4 PLC-AAD aims to develop and construct an open data ecosystem in environments for automated driving that enables the efficient exchange of data and services while also ensuring the necessary security at the technical level.

### DaSKITA

[**Data Sovereignty Through AI-based Transparency and Access (Datensouveränität durch KI-basierte Transparenz und Auskunft (DaSKITA))**](https://daskita.github.io/)

The aim of this project was the design and prototypical implementation of AI-based concepts, mechanisms and tools which enable consumers to obtain a higher level of awareness and self-determination in the context of data-driven services. Transparency and the right of access have always been an integral part of privacy / data-protection regulations: to be able to act in a sovereign and self-determined way in everyday digital life, consumers need to know 'who knows what, when, and on what occasion about them' (BVerfG 1983, RN 94). In close cooperation between computer science, legal and socio-political research as well as corporate practice, AI-based technologies for the low-effort exercise of transparency and access rights, for simplified reception of appropriate information and its machine-readable provision by service providers were to be developed in this project.

### EMIDD

[**Consent Management for the Internet of Things (Einwilligungsmanagement für das internet der Dinge)**](https://github.com/EMIDD-Projekt)

Individual, informed, specific and explicitly given consent is one of the main pillars of data protection law. Traditionally, such consent has been given, for example, in writing or by ticking a box under a privacy statement several pages long. In the context of the IoT - where, on the one hand, traditional user interfaces are not available and, on the other, data once collected can be used for a variety of other desirable purposes - this approach is obviously no longer viable. Instead, new, technically supported approaches to consent management are needed. In the EMIDD project, possibilities of such technical approaches as well as their connectivity to current and future data protection law were being researched, including the design, prototypical implementation, and evaluation of respective mechanisms.

* Project duration: 04/2017 - 06/2018
* Involved PEPSys members and role: [Frank Pallas](/team/fp) (PI and overall project lead)

### DITAS

[**Data-intensive Applications Improvement by moving Data and Computation in mixed Cloud/Fog Environments**](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/731945)

New data intensive applications such as autonomous driving, e-health or industry 4.0 require faster response times and stronger privacy and security guarantees than current cloud providers can offer. Fog computing is one way to address these requirements but also introduces new challenges in matters such as security or privacy. DITAS envisioned, designed and prototypically implemented a respective cloud-edge data management system that is aware of resource limitations of edge locations and helps to synchronize data between cloud and edge while still complying with privacy and security requirements. On this basis, information in the e-health context, for instance, can only be shared with research institutions, and only after the data was anonymized and the patients gave their explicit agreement to share their data.
